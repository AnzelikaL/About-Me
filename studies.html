                I am currently studying <strong>Neuroscience with Psychology</strong>, a fascinating and rigorous four-year course that offers a deep dive into the intricacies of the human brain and behavior. The course primarily focuses on <span class="highlight">Neuroscience</span>, which is the study of the nervous system, encompassing brain structure, function, and the complex mechanisms that underlie cognition, emotion, and sensory processing. Neuroscience bridges several disciplines, including biology, chemistry, and medical sciences, allowing me to explore topics like neural pathways, neuroplasticity, and neuropharmacology. Due to its emphasis on medical-related subjects, the course provides profound insights into understanding and addressing neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, and Parkinson's disease.
            </p>
            <p>
                I enjoy every aspect of the course and find it intellectually stimulating. While the challenges can be demanding, they are manageable and motivate me to grow academically. Regular laboratory sessions, which are typically long but engaging, allow me to apply theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios. These labs are integral to the course, as they foster hands-on learning and enhance my understanding of experimental procedures, data analysis, and the scientific method.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my first year, I chose <span class="highlight">Translation and Interpreting</span> courses as bonus modules for both semesters. This year, I ventured into <span class="highlight">Computing Science modules</span>, which have introduced me to new skills in programming and data handling. These additional courses reflect my curiosity and open-minded nature, as I enjoy trying things that are significantly different from my main discipline. My approach to diversifying my academic journey stems from my belief that these interdisciplinary experiences are valuable and equip me with versatile skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                While my program does not originally include an industrial placement, I aspire to secure one to extend the course by an additional year. I view this as an opportunity to gain practical industry experience, enrich my academic learning, and broaden my career prospects. Overall, I am passionate about my field and excited to continue exploring the vast and captivating world of neuroscience while embracing opportunities beyond the core curriculum.
