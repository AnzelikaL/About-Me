                    <h3>Scotland (2023-Present)</h3>
                    <p>
                        I moved here to study. So far my experience has been pleasant, and I enjoy living here. 
                        I have bought a flat here, so it might be a place I stay for a long time, but we never know 
                        as I don't like staying in the same place for too long if it were my choice. In Scotland, 
                        I have visited many attractions and events, as well as different cafes and restaurants.

                    <h3>England (2014-2023)</h3>
                    <p>
                        I have lived here for a very long time, almost as much as I have lived in Latvia. 
                        When I came here I knew no English, so I had to start learning from scratch. 
                        I finished secondary school and A-Levels here. Life was fun but different since 
                        we lived in a city. We visited attractions, fun rooms, and everything felt new to me.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Latvia (2013-2014 and 2004-2012)</h3>
                    <p>
                        I have lived there since I was born. I went to school there, and life was simple. 
                        I used to go out with my friends every day to the park, go fishing, and swim in the lake 
                        whenever it was warm. It was a peaceful and joyful time in my life.

                    <h3>Cyprus (2012-2013)</h3>
                    <p>
                        We lived there only for a year, but during that time, I really enjoyed my life. 
                        Every weekend, we would go to new places for mountain biking and other events and sports. 
                        It was a fun and adventurous time for me and my family.
